# RapidRAW code map

This is a maintainer's map of the current source tree. It covers hand-maintained
application files and their responsibilities. Read this alongside the
user-facing [root README](../README.md) and the separate [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
This document describes the current implementation.

## Runtime diagnostics

`logging.rs` sends native debug diagnostics to stderr. `RUST_LOG` selects a single
log level. Release builds, including portable distributions, use
`release_max_level_off` to compile out native log calls. `main.tsx` assigns silent
console methods in the production frontend.

Run `node scripts/test-logging.mjs` to check production console suppression,
debug console availability and diagnostic configuration.

## Current editing implementation

Export-setting presets and crop aspect-ratio choices are independent features.
The composition guide is Rule of Thirds; `O` toggles it on/off.

### Pick and Reject flags

`P` picks, `X` rejects, and `U` clears flags on
selected images. The bottom bar has toggles; thumbnails/list/filmstrip show badges
and dim rejects. Catalog flag filters combine with metadata filters and smart groups.
Flags are mutually exclusive internal `flag:pick`/`flag:reject` sidecar tags; SQLite
rebuilds the flag column from those tags. Flagging updates sidecar metadata and the catalog index.
`node scripts/test-image-flags.mjs` checks selection scope, queued writes, toggling,
clear, pending-page overlays and error rollback with in-memory stores/IPC only.

### Adjustment panels and curves

Adjustment panel customization is accessible in Settings → Customization only. Drag handles reorder sections and tool groups; eye buttons hide them.
Section/tool collapse state and layout are saved in `adjustmentLayout`. Hiding a
control changes its UI visibility; section enable/disable controls govern processing.
Startup migrates saved `adjustmentVisibility` preferences into
the current layout when `adjustmentLayout` is absent.
Shift/Alt slows curve dragging to one fifth; inactive channels show colored curves
and parametric reference markers.

### Guided filtering and export profiles

Guided-filter coefficients are built from log luminance/dark-channel statistics at
bounded resolution, cached with the GPU input, and sampled across render tiles.
Clarity, structure, dehaze and tonal detail recovery use them in preview and export.
Gaussian blur serves sharpening/glow/halation where needed. JPEG/PNG
encoders embed the bundled CC0 sRGB profile independently of EXIF preservation.
Thumbnail disk cache keys include the renderer revision; mismatched renders are
regenerated on demand.

### Kelvin white balance and area sampling

White balance uses a `whiteBalance: { temperature, tint }` adjustment
object (or `null` for camera/default balance), including masks. Frontend adjustment
normalization retains this object as the white-balance input. `src/utils/whiteBalance.ts`
defines UI limits and logarithmic Kelvin slider scaling. `Color.tsx` displays Kelvin
and tint; `ImageCanvas.tsx` maps clicked/dragged regions through crop, orientation,
flips and perspective into original-image coordinates.

`src-tauri/src/white_balance.rs` converts camera matrices/neutral coefficients into
as-shot Kelvin/tint and computes Bradford LMS adaptation. Its bounded metadata cache
is keyed by path, modification time and file length. `raw_processing.rs` reads the
camera white from RAW metadata. `LoadedImage` carries the reference
white through preview, thumbnails and export. The `sample_white_balance` command
checks the requested image path, averages linear original pixels in a quadrilateral
on a blocking worker, and caps work at 262144 samples. It rejects invalid/dark samples.
Frontend session/generation guards discard stale picks when switching images/tools.
Run `cargo test --lib white_balance` in `src-tauri` for numerical and area-sampling tests.
Run `node scripts/test-white-balance.mjs` for frontend defaults, limits and slider scaling.

### Brush interactions

`ImageCanvas.tsx` keeps active Clone/Heal stroke points in local refs. A Konva
line previews the unfinished stroke; release commits one sidecar mask update.
Changing the image or active mask cancels an unfinished stroke. Normal Brush/Flow
masks retain live previews. Image processing and thumbnail invalidation follow
the normal adjustment path.

Legacy `quick-selection` sidecar masks load as ordinary Brush masks, retaining
their painted strokes, opacity and combination mode. The frontend normalizes
the old type; native mask dispatch accepts it as a brush for direct sidecar loads.
The resulting bitmap uses the stored brush shape.
`node scripts/test-mask-compat.mjs` checks that frontend normalization preserves
strokes, IDs, visibility, opacity and blend mode while preserving the loaded object.
The native `legacy_brush_tests` test verifies the same bitmap as an ordinary brush.

### Workspace panel layout

`LibraryView.tsx` and `EditorView.tsx` each own one `PanelVisibilityMenu` within
their central workspace.
`BottomBar.tsx` reserves space to the right of its action icons for this control,
which stays accessible when the bottom bar is hidden. Import is available in the
bottom bar and empty-library prompt.

The library's flex chain uses `min-h-0` and clips the grid to its allotted viewport.
`LibraryGrid.tsx` gives react-window a 100%-height flex viewport. Its ResizeObserver
tracks width for row layout. The bottom bar retains its height and uses a separate
stacking level to remain visible above the thumbnail grid.

### Catalog panels, paging and smart groups

`CatalogPanel.tsx` renders capture-date years/months/days and the recursive album
hierarchy. Groups use persisted `expandedAlbumGroups`; creating a group expands
it and its parent. The saved panel ID `folderTree` is retained only as a workspace
compatibility identifier for `Panel.Catalog`.

`useCatalog.ts`, mounted by App, initializes and loads the catalog independently
of panel visibility. Search is debounced and stale query replies are discarded.
`catalog_query_page` returns bounded rows and a filtered SQL count from one SQLite
read transaction. The shared filter builder ensures the page and count match;
the header shows page X of Y, match count and catalog total. Empty results show
page 1 of 1. When results shrink, an out-of-range page is clamped and reloaded.
Catalog mode owns the page-navigation controls.

Right-click a smart group → Edit filters opens the filter panel and loads its
criteria into a draft. Saving updates that group's ID in the existing hierarchy.
Cancel editing leaves the stored group
unchanged. Legacy single-value filters are normalized by `normalizeCatalogFilter`;
`updateSmartGroup` updates nested smart groups in their existing positions.

Catalog folders → Rescan folders incrementally checks disk changes; internal
refreshes reload index/facet data. The export panel handles GUI export, and external
edit sessions coordinate round trips with other editors.

## Application overview

This is a customized RapidRAW build focused on local photo management and
non-destructive RAW editing.

- SQLite indexes the local photo library.
- Original photos remain on the filesystem; edits are stored separately.
- RAW development and image processing run locally.
- Model-based processing is used for noise reduction.

## How the parts fit together

```text
src/main.tsx -> src/App.tsx -> views/panels -> hooks and Zustand stores
                                      |
                                      v
                        Tauri invoke / event listeners
                                      |
                                      v
                  src-tauri/src/lib.rs -> Rust modules
                                      |
                       files, sidecars, SQLite, RAW engine
```

The React frontend owns presentation and temporary UI state. Rust owns disk
I/O, image decoding/rendering, export, and the SQLite catalog. Shared command
names and frontend data contracts live in `src/components/ui/AppProperties.tsx`;
Tauri command registration is near the end of `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`.

The catalog database is a rebuildable index. Photos stay at their paths, and
sidecar/XMP files store edits and metadata. The catalog view queries bounded pages.

Thumbnail requests and caches are bounded. Removing a catalog entry is separate
from deleting its source file. File operations synchronize the catalog index.
See [catalog-focused-build.md](catalog-focused-build.md) for query/loading details.

Catalog filters are combined in SQLite, while
`src/utils/catalog.ts` retains the active image's optimistic rating when a new
rating removes it from the filtered page. Opening a video catalog entry launches
the system player.
RAW development has one path: `raw_processing.rs` uses the linked rawler crate
and hands pixels to `image_loader.rs` in memory. `highlight_recovery.rs` applies the
user setting after development; Linear RAW Processing is controlled by the
persistent `linear_raw_mode` setting. Clone/Heal strokes live in sidecar mask adjustments and
are composited during image rendering; the source image remains intact.

## Updating the RAW engine

From the project root, updating rawler in the source code only requires:

```powershell
cargo update --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml -p rawler
```

`Cargo.toml` points to upstream rawler and `Cargo.lock` records the selected
revision. Keep the updated lockfile. Rebuild RapidRAW normally afterward.
If upstream changes its API, adapt `raw_processing.rs` (development/orientation)
and `exif_processing.rs` (metadata). `image_loader.rs` receives decoded pixels
directly in memory.
`multi_exposure.rs` and `highlight_recovery.rs` provide additional processing.
Linear RAW Processing and Highlight Recovery are persisted in `app_settings.rs`.

## Push to github

```powershell
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/arvid-storck/RapidRAWnoAIwithCatalog.git
git fetch origin
git reset --mixed origin/main
git branch -M main
git add -A
git commit -m "Text här"
git push -u origin main
```

## Development checks

```powershell
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run i18n:check
npm run i18n:lint
node scripts/test-catalog.mjs
node scripts/test-image-flags.mjs
node scripts/test-white-balance.mjs
npm run build
cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --lib
```

Run `npm ci` first if dependencies were cleaned. Frontend build, TypeScript,
translation validation and native tests are separate checks.

The optimized debug profile disables incremental application codegen to avoid
stale anonymous LLVM symbols in cross-crate `image_hasher` code when linking the
Windows executable (`LNK2019` followed by `LNK1120`). Dependency artifacts remain
cached. Keep `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0` when reproducing the linker issue.
Native library tests verify the library's test cases. Run
`cargo build --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --bin RapidRAW` to
check debug linking, and `npm run tauri -- build --no-bundle` to verify the
production executable with its embedded frontend.

The native app uses Windows/macOS/Linux icons referenced by Tauri and the
Linux packaging icon.

### Dependency and distribution size

- Application file/process operations run in Rust. `tauri-plugin-fs` arrives transitively through
  the dialog plugin, whose filesystem scope integration is optional.
- Frontend icons use Lucide. Process/file operations use native Rust commands;
  futures crates arrive as transitive dependencies.
- Tokio explicitly requests its multithreaded runtime, synchronization and
  timers. Networking features needed by HTTPS dependencies remain transitive.
- Imageproc enables Rayon for parallel image processing.
  Separate image hashing and supported codecs have their own dependencies.
- Sysinfo enables disk and system/memory queries. Reqwest enables JSON/HTTPS.
- ORT uses the verified ONNX runtime supplied by `build.rs`; its
  enabled features provide standard-library, ndarray and tracing support.
  The runtime-load regression test checks native library initialization.
- Release uses speed optimization, LTO and symbol stripping, with unwinding
  retained for panics.
- Portable Windows packaging includes the EXE, Windows ONNX runtime and
  application resources/licenses. It reports EXE, folder and ZIP sizes.

`npm run clean` removes generated build caches. Export portable output before
cleaning, and use a fresh output directory for portable builds.
`npm run clean:deep` adds `node_modules` and the explicit runtime files
`src-tauri/resources/onnxruntime.dll`, `libonnxruntime.so` and
`libonnxruntime.dylib` to cleanup. `build.rs` downloads the required platform
runtime when needed. Both commands support `-- --dry-run` to preview cleanup targets.

Package sizes depend on the toolchain, dependency versions and bundled resources.
Use the portable script's size report for the build being distributed.
Interactive UI and real-camera regression checks are separate from automated tests.
