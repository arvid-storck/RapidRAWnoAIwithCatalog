- **2026-10-09 — Runtime logging cleanup:** Removed app.log file creation, the log-file Settings action and IPC commands, frontend log forwarding/console interception, unused log translations and fern. Native debug diagnostics now use stderr only; release/portable builds compile out native logging and disable frontend console output. Converted remaining direct native diagnostic prints to log calls. Existing log files are not deleted automatically.

- **2026-10-08 — Dead-code cleanup:** Removed the unreachable legacy library header and compare-view components, their obsolete translations and inactive search-focus shortcut/state, and the unused native inverse-point transformation helper. Kept the active catalog UI, culling dialog and image processing. Moved the test-only tempfile dependency into dev-dependencies and synchronized the implementation code map.
- **2026-10-08 — Removed Quick Selection:** Removed the tool, its controls/translations, pointer handling, native edge-refinement/softening algorithms and feature tests. Normal Brush/Flow and Clone/Heal remain. Legacy selection masks load as ordinary brush strokes so saved mask containers remain editable; their old refined contours are no longer reproduced. Updated the current implementation documentation and thumbnail-cache revision.
- **2026-10-08 — Windows debug linking:** Disabled incremental application codegen in the optimized debug profile after an unresolved anonymous LLVM symbol in `image_hasher` prevented the desktop EXE from linking (`LNK2019`/`LNK1120`). Dependency caches and runtime optimization remain intact. Added explicit desktop-binary linking checks to the maintainer documentation; library tests alone do not cover this link step.
- **2026-10-08 — Stronger local edge adaptation:** Quick Selection now compares nearby foreground and background colors and adapts sensitivity to local contrast instead of ignoring differences below a fixed threshold. Hue differences at similar luminance also influence the contour. Movement remains bounded by Edge search distance; core preservation, erasing and adjustable effect feathering remain intact. Added subtle-contrast and chromatic-edge regression tests.
- **2026-10-08 — Adjustable selection softness:** Added Edge softness to Quick Selection (0–100 original-image pixels, default 2). Higher values widen the soft inner transition; 0 gives a hard contour. Search distance remains independent, and the filled core, contour support and erased holes are preserved. Added softness-width and legacy-default regression tests.
- **2026-10-08 — Soft refined selection edges:** Restored a narrow soft transition on the inside of the refined Quick Selection contour. The filled core stays opaque, and softening adds no coverage outside the selection or inside erased holes. Added boundary-softness and no-halo regression checks and updated thumbnail-cache revision.
- **2026-10-08 — Solid Quick Selection:** Removed the feathered selection halo when refinement is enabled. The contour moves outward or inward toward nearby image edges while retaining a filled painted core. Detached edge fragments are removed and enclosed gaps are filled within the local search band; deliberate eraser holes remain excluded. Feather is available only with refinement disabled (search distance 0). Updated thumbnail-cache revision and added core, halo, connectivity and eraser/repaint regression tests.
- **2026-10-08 — Panel layout and local selection:** Removed Import from the library header; it remains in the bottom bar and empty-library prompt. Fixed library viewport sizing when the bottom panel is hidden and shown again. Kept Show/hide panels within the central workspace and reserved space beside the bottom action icons. Quick Selection now refines painted boundaries locally instead of growing across connected image regions. Edge search distance is adjustable from 0–200 original-image pixels (default 20); 0 disables refinement. Updated the thumbnail-cache revision so old selection renders regenerate on demand.
- **2026-10-08 — Workspace and catalog cleanup:** Moved Customize panels into Settings only and lowered the panel-visibility menu. Replaced the large Catalog button and “images shown” label with page X of Y and matching/total image counts. Removed the header Refresh button: it only reloaded the index, not scanned files; use Catalog folders → Rescan folders to find disk changes.
- **2026-10-08 — Albums and masking:** Fixed ordinary album groups being hidden, auto-expanded newly created groups, and added right-click → Edit filters for existing smart groups. Healing/Cloning now previews the stroke locally and commits once on release. Added classic, non-AI Quick Selection with color/contrast-based connected-region selection, tolerance and erasing. Selection is refined after releasing the brush.
- **2026-10-08 — Code and translations:** Removed FolderTree and its unused navigation state, commands and folder dialogs, CLI batch export and unused editing-preset migration. Kept GUI export, export-setting presets, crop ratios and external-editor round trips. Localized panel visibility, catalog/import controls, remaining literal UI labels and notifications. Catalog loading no longer depends on the filter panel being visible. Updated current implementation documentation and added catalog/group regression checks.
- **2026-10-06:** Removed the editing Presets panel, community-preset browser and camera tethering. Simplified composition guides to Rule of Thirds, removed unused icons and splash-image references, and updated maintainer documentation.
- **2026-10-06 — Selected RapidRAW 1.6.5 features:** Added Pick/Reject flags (P/X/U), badges and catalog filtering; cached edge-aware guided filtering for detail and tonal adjustments; precision curves with Shift/Alt fine adjustment and inactive-channel references; embedded sRGB ICC profiles in JPEG/PNG exports; and persistent panel/tool ordering, visibility and collapse controls. No cloud or generative-AI features were imported.
- **2026-10-06 — Kelvin white balance:** Replaced the old relative white-balance controls with temperature in Kelvin (2000–50000 K) and tint. In Color → White Balance, click the pipette and click a neutral spot or drag over a neutral area. Sampling uses the original image and works with GPU previews. RAW starts from its camera white balance; preview, thumbnails and export share the same correction. Old relative temperature/tint edits are no longer applied; re-set white balance on previously edited images if needed.
- **2026-10-06 — Deep cleanup:** `npm run clean:deep` also removes downloaded ONNX runtime libraries from the source project's resources. Regular `clean` keeps them; the next native build downloads the required library again.
- **2026-10-06 — Cleanup:** Removed the editing Presets panel and mask-preset actions, community-preset browser, camera tethering, unused icons and splash-image references. Rule of Thirds is now the only composition guide. Updated the code map and kept technical structure documentation in `docs/README.md`.
- **2026-10-06 — Library defaults:** Default sorting is now capture date (oldest first). Display, thumbnail-size and layout menus use the same theme-aware appearance as the sort menu. Saved sorting preferences remain respected.
- **2026-10-06 — Build size:** Removed unused Shell/filesystem plugin registration, unused frontend dependencies and unused Rust dependency features. Kept all image formats, rendering performance and noise reduction. Portable Windows packaging excludes other platforms' ONNX runtimes and reports package sizes.
- **2026-10-02 — In-process RAW:** Restored the built-in rawler developer and Linear RAW Processing options. RAW pixels now stay in memory instead of being written to a temporary transfer image. Removed the external RAW component and its updater; Lensfun profile updates remain available. Rawler updates are now a source/dependency change followed by an application rebuild.
- **2026-10-01 — Library, zoom, and RAW:** Fixed masonry selection scroll positions, improved library display-menu contrast, aligned zoom limits with decoded/cropped image dimensions, and switched RAW development to the separately installed external Rawler component. The external Rawler 0.8 source contains the Olympus E-M1X CFA-pattern fix.
- **2026-09-29 — RAW and retouching:** Made Highlight Recovery adjustable and switchable for both RAW-engine paths, exposed non-destructive Clone and Heal spot tools with a selectable source, and kept an edited image's rating visible when a new rating removes it from an active catalog filter.
- **2026-09-28 — Validation:** Fixed lint errors, completed missing plural forms, and synchronized newly extracted translation keys. Existing explicit `any` types remain visible as lint warnings; untranslated new strings retain English fallback text.
- **2026-09-28 — Desktop focus:** Removed Android build/release wiring and Android-only UI and native integration. Desktop targets remain Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **2026-09-28 — Zoom performance:** Started high-resolution zoom previews sooner, skipped analytics work for zoom-only renders, reduced redundant editor updates, and avoided full-size empty mask uploads on unmasked images.
- **2026-09-28 — Editing and export:** Added adjustable RAW highlight recovery, smoother vibrance, crop/pan/zoom shortcuts, a justified masonry-style library layout, a neutral-grey canvas setting, and true 8/16-bit TIFF export options while retaining catalog and configurable maximum zoom behavior.
- **2026-09-28 — Catalog and import:** Restored EXIF fallback when loading and saving sidecars, made `I` restore the Info panel's previous state, separated already-existing files from import failures, and added video import/catalog entries that open in the system player.
- **2026-09-26 — UI cleanup:** Removed the bulk “Clear All Tags” action and bottom-right panel toggle buttons; moved the panel-visibility menu lower and kept filmstrip visibility there.
- **2026-09-26 — Maintenance:** Added `npm run clean` for frontend and both Rust build-output directories, plus optional `npm run clean:deep` for installed npm dependencies.
- **2026-09-26 — Documentation:** Added a maintainer [code map](docs/README.md) covering the frontend, Rust modules, scripts, and where to edit common features.
- **2026-09-24 — Import and layout:** Added copy, move, and index-at-existing-location import choices; moved maximum zoom into Settings, set its new default to 100%, and made the top, bottom, left, and right panels hideable.
- **2026-09-24 — Portable data and navigation:** Kept portable settings and other program data alongside the portable EXE; refined import access and moved catalog page controls beside Catalog in the top bar.
- **2026-09-16 — Large libraries:** Made the catalog the primary library workflow with bounded 500-image pages, SQLite-side filtering/sorting, incremental loading, and thumbnail-cache pruning.
- **2026-09-16 — Filters and size:** Added combinable multi-select camera, lens, rating (including 0), tag, color, and file-type filters. Removed unused upstream AI-oriented UI/build paths while retaining noise reduction.
- **2026-09-04 — Catalog UI:** Added the year/month/day Catalog dates tree in place of folder browsing, fixed EXIF date display, and added image context-menu actions for catalog removal separately from file deletion.
- **2026-09-04 — Portable Windows:** Fixed a portable build that incorrectly required the localhost development server and produced a self-contained ZIP with bundled resources.
- **2026-09-03 — Catalog:** Added a rebuildable SQLite index for explicitly added folders, metadata and sidecar indexing, corruption recovery, incremental rescans, and removal from the index without deleting photos.
- **2026-09-03 — Filters and albums:** Added catalog metadata filtering, dynamic tag choices from indexed images, and smart groups based on catalog filter criteria.
- **2026-09-03 — Components:** Added separate in-app RAW-engine and Lensfun update actions with restart support when required.
